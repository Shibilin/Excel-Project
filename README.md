Sales Analysis as Excel Project

Project overview :-
In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing bike sales information and created some insights. The dataset contains different attributes such as Age grouping, Region, Commute Distance, Purchase Count ect. Using this data i have created 6 insights and 1 main analysis chart. These insights and main analysis chart covered areas such as Sales based on region, Based on commute distance, Based on gender ect. By identifying the top-saled region and understanding other factors which influenced sales, the analysis provides valuable information for strategic decision-making in market.

Additionally, I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize these insights effectively. This dashboard allows users to explore the data dynamically, offering features like filter options, Slicers, and ineractive charts. This helps users quickly grasp the insights in the bike sales data. I have created this dashboard specifically designed to ensure that, even those without a background in data analysis can understand and utilize the informations presented. Overall this project aims to enhance the understanding of bike sales and support buisness strategy.

NB: On the left side of every page i have created special box to make users easy to switch the main worksheets. If you want to know more about me click on "About me" icon which i have placed in the same box. If you would like to mail me regarding any query, click on "Email" on the same box.

Hope you like the work..!!
